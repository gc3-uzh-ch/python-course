Object-oriented Python training, March 12-13, 2013
==================================================

This 2-day course assumes generic familiarity with programming and
basic computer programming concepts like variables, functions,
programs.

On day 1, Python syntax will be recapped and then, on day 2, we
proceed on to object-orientation.

[[Registration|#index8h2]] is open until **Friday, March 8, 2013**.


[[!toc startlevel=2]]

## Who
This introductory course is aimed at those who want to learn how to
use python for implementing their own scientific scripts and programs.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you are already familiar with scripting languages
(e.g. bash, perl) and have already written some computer programs.

## What
This course will cover the basics of python programming and object-orientation.

The first day of the course introduces Python syntax and the
fundamental data types.

The second day of the course covers Object-oriented Python: the basic
concepts of object-oriented programming (class, instances, interfaces
and inheritance) are introduced along with Python code examples.  Then
we delve into object-oriented Python idioms that every working Python
programmer should know about.

## When
_March 12-13_ 2013.

On each day, the course starts at 9:30 and ends by 15:30.

## Where

The training takes place at the [UZH Irchel campus](http://www.mnf.uzh.ch/en/studies/irchel-campus.html).

On Tuesday 12th March, the training will be in room
[Y13][y13] M 12 (that's _room 12_ on _floor M_ in [building Y13][y13]).

On Wednesday 13th March, the training takes place in room
[Y21][y21] D 68a (that's _room 68a_ on _floor D_ in [building Y21][y21]).

## Needed equipment

In order to attend the course, you will need to have your own laptop
with wireless LAN connectivity.  In addition, the following software
is needed:

- Python, at least version 2.6
- a terminal application
- a text editor (e.g., [Emacs][1], [`vi`][2], or [gedit][3])

[1]: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/
[2]: http://www.vim.org/
[3]: http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/

MacOSX and [recent versions of GNU/Linux][^1] all come with these programs preinstalled.

[^1]: Ubuntu 12.04, Debian "squeeze", and CentOS6 are all fine choices in this respect.

If your computer does not run Linux or MacOSX, you might consider
running a Linux Virtual Machine in your usual operating system.
[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) is a freely-available
virtualization software that runs on MacOSX and Windows:

- You can download VirtualBox for your computer from <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>

- You can download a Ubuntu 12.04 virtual machine with all software needed for the course from the following links:

  * for 32-bit computers: <http://www.gc3.uzh.ch/teaching/gc3pie/GC3PieX32.ova>
  * for 64-bit computers: <http://www.gc3.uzh.ch/teaching/gc3pie/GC3PieX64.ova>

  These virtual machine files will run under the VirtualBox or VMware emulators.
