Object-oriented Python training, March 12-13, 2013
==================================================

This 2-day course assumes generic familiarity with programming and
basic computer programming concepts like variables, functions,
programs.

On day 1, Python syntax will be recapped and then, on day 2, we
proceed on to object-orientation.

[[Registration|#index8h2]] is open until **Friday, March 8, 2013**.


[[!toc startlevel=2]]

## Who
This introductory course is aimed at those who want to learn how to
use python for implementing their own scientific scripts and programs.

## Prerequisites
We assume that you are already familiar with scripting languages
(e.g. bash, perl) and have already written some computer programs.

## What
This course will cover the basics of python programming and object-orientation.

The first day of the course introduces Python syntax and the
fundamental data types.

The second day of the course covers Object-oriented Python: the basic
concepts of object-oriented programming (class, instances, interfaces
and inheritance) are introduced along with Python code examples.  Then
we delve into object-oriented Python idioms that every working Python
programmer should know about.

## When
_March 12-13_ 2013.

On each day, the course starts at 9:30 and ends by 15:30.

## Where

The training takes place at the [UZH Irchel campus](http://www.mnf.uzh.ch/en/studies/irchel-campus.html).

On Tuesday 12th March, the training will be in room
[Y13][y13] M 12 (that's _room 12_ on _floor M_ in [building Y13][y13]).

On Wednesday 13th March, the training takes place in room
[Y21][y21] D 68a (that's _room 68a_ on _floor D_ in [building Y21][y21]).
